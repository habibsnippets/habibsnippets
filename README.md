## Hi y'all

My name is habib, a deep learning engineer interested in researching about llm inference and computer vision. I mainly work in image processing and robotics related stuff at a startup right now. Will try to maintain this github repo with my small experimentation projects. Do check out my blogs and notes [here](https://habib.bearblog.dev/).
